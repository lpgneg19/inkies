# Inkies v0.4.0

This release focuses on UI simplification and stability improvements.

## What's New

### 🎨 Simplified Theme System
- **Cleaner Menu**: The theme selection has been moved up one level for faster access. "Theme" is now a direct picker in the menu bar.
- **Focused Options**: We've removed the "Follow System" option to provide a more predictable manual control over the app's appearance. Choose between **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode**.

### 🛠 Stability and Fixes
- **Build Success**: Resolved critical compilation errors that were affecting the project build pipeline.
- **Improved Reliability**: Fixed issues with HTML generation during web export to ensure consistent output across different themes.
